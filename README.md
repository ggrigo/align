# align

Personal evals for Claude Code and Cowork. Capture the corrections you'd otherwise mutter and forget — rate LLM claims as **correct / wrong / almost / needs-nuance / can't-verify / irrelevant / skipped** in a local HTML form, archive as machine-readable markdown, and feed patterns back into your prompts and `CLAUDE.md`.

## Why

You read three Claude outputs today. Two of them were partially wrong — claim 4 confused two people; claim 12 cited a stale deadline. You said *"that's not quite right"* in your head and moved on. **The signal evaporated.** Next week, the same producer makes the same kind of mistake — because nothing in the loop learned from your reaction.

`align` turns the muttering into a structured artifact:

1. A skill (`/rhythm`, `/digest`, anything that produces claims) emits its output.
2. `/align` extracts the claims into an interactive HTML form.
3. You rate each claim in 2 minutes. Notes go on the wrong/almost/nuance ones.
4. The download is a structured `.md` file — corrections, confirmations, missing items.
5. Phase 2 reads the file, applies updates (TASKS.md, smart-memory when available), and archives the datapoint.
6. Patterns mined from the archive feed back into the originating skill's prompts and your `CLAUDE.md`.

After 90 days, you have a calibrated corpus of your own taste — in your repo, queryable with `grep`.

## Install

### Claude Code

```bash
# From a marketplace once published:
/plugin install align@<marketplace>

# Local install during dev:
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/align
```

### Cowork

Upload the `.plugin` zip via the Cowork Plugins modal → "Upload plugin".

### Both surfaces consume the same artifact

A `align/` directory with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at root works identically in Claude Code (loaded via `--plugin-dir` or marketplace install) and Cowork (zipped with `.plugin` extension and uploaded). No dual build.

Multi-skill plugin as of v0.7.0: `skills/align/SKILL.md` and `skills/retro/SKILL.md` are the canonical skill files. Invocation: `/align` and `/retro` (or `/align:align` and `/align:retro` for namespaced form). Skill `SKILL.md` files MUST start with `---` on line 1 (YAML frontmatter) — anything before that breaks plugin validation on Cowork. The `references/` files are loaded on demand by Claude when a skill cites them — they're not in the always-loaded context.

## Extending — using /align with a new producer

The skill is source-agnostic by contract. Any producer that emits an array of claim objects matching the Claim Adapter Contract in `SKILL.md` can be aligned. A new producer needs to:

1. Walk its output and identify *falsifiable claims*.
2. Build the array with required fields (`id`, `text`, `source`) and any useful optional fields (`time`, `icon`, `desc`, `detail`, `categories`, `verifiable`).
3. Invoke `/align` with a kebab-case context slug.

No instrumentation contract beyond the array. The producer can live in this plugin, in another plugin, or in an ad-hoc Claude turn. Existing non-rhythm producers in the archive: daily todo prints, headcount files, benchmark-design reports.

## Usage

```
/align                       # extract claims from the latest claim-producing output
/align rhythm                # use "rhythm" as the context slug
/align todo                  # use "todo" as the context slug
/align done                  # process the downloaded .md (Phase 2)
/retro                       # synthesize the archive (last 7 days, all sources)
/retro 2026-05               # restrict to a month
/retro rhythm                # restrict to one source slug
/retro apply                 # Stage 2 — open PRs from the most recent pass's proposed patches
/retro apply <pass-file>     # apply patches from a specific pass
/retro apply --dry-run       # show what /retro apply would do without writing
```

The skill auto-detects which claim-producing output to read from the current conversation. Pass a context hint as the first argument to override the filename slug.

`/retro` reads the archive and writes one synthesis pass document per run — aggregate metrics, failure-mode clusters, proposed patches with human-review gates. Never modifies the archive. `/retro apply` is the Stage-2 gate: the human approves which proposed patches become real PRs. See `references/retro-design.md` for the architecture.

**How often to run.** Run `/align` whenever you make a significant change to a producer (a new prompt, a new claim shape, a new system context). Run `/retro` every 2–4 weeks on accumulated traces, or whenever the archive has grown by ~100 entries since the last pass. Per [Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar's evals workflow](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals), the operational saturation heuristic is "if ~20 new traces don't surface a new failure category, the corpus is saturated." For small projects, scale the numbers down — even 20–50 outputs per significant change gives signal.

## Cross-surface design

- **Surface-neutral handoff**: the form's absolute path is the canonical artifact. Cowork sessions additionally get a `computer://` quick-open affordance; Claude Code sessions use the `file://` link or the absolute path directly.
- **Surface-agnostic dropbox**: Phase 2 checks `~/Downloads/`, the active working folder, `incoming-docs/` (Cowork convention), and `cwd` (Claude Code convention) — picks the most recent `align-*.md` by mtime.
- **Smart-memory guard**: if smart-memory MCP tools aren't wired, corrections are queued to `align-corrections-pending.md` in the archive folder and drained by the next session that has the tools. No correction is ever dropped.
- **Configurable timezone**: the `.md` "Generated:" timestamp uses a `{{TIMEZONE}}` placeholder; falls back to the browser's local zone if unsubstituted.

## What this does NOT do

- Org-scale evaluation. There's no team dashboard, no shared queue, no org-wide accuracy metrics. By design.
- Run as a hosted service. Everything is files on disk in your repo. By design.
- Generalize across users. Your corrections are *your* corrections. By design.

If you want LangSmith / Humanloop / Braintrust / Phoenix functionality, install those. `align` competes with *no tool at all* — the workflow of reading an LLM output, muttering "that's wrong," and moving on.

## Closest prior art

- **EvalGen / criteria drift** ([Shankar et al., UIST 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12272)) — the strongest conceptual match. Some evaluation criteria can only be articulated *after* grading outputs, and users revise earlier grades as criteria sharpen. EvalGen sits upstream of `/align`: it generates candidate evaluator implementations and uses humans to select; `/align` skips evaluator-generation and asks the human to grade each session directly. The taxonomy (correct/wrong/almost/needs-nuance/can't-verify/irrelevant/skipped) is the fixed UI; the per-claim reality notes are where criteria evolve.
- **Hamel Husain & Shreya Shankar's evals course** ([AI Evals For Engineers & PMs](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals)) — Hamel and Shreya (the EvalGen lead author above) teach the manual workflow: review ~100+ traces by hand, open-code reactions in free text, cluster into a failure taxonomy, count categories, iterate to theoretical saturation. `/align` operationalizes the inner loop — each per-claim rating is an open-coded observation; the 7-shape taxonomy is the failure-taxonomy UI; `/retro` is the across-session clustering step. The two prior-art entries above aren't independent — Shreya leads on EvalGen and co-teaches with Hamel.

## Maintenance

`/align` is authored by [Georgios Grigoriadis](https://github.com/ggrigo) and maintained by **agent ggrigo** ([`agent-ggrigo`](https://github.com/agent-ggrigo)) — an LLM agent operating on a standing mandate from Georgios. The agent identifies itself as the maintainer in issues, PRs, releases, and replies. It defers to Georgios on contested judgment.

The recursion is structural: `/align` exists to grade LLM outputs, and the agent's own outputs (PR comments, release notes, this section) are LLM outputs. The agent dogfoods the tool on its own work; scorecards ship with each release (see [v0.6.0 release notes](https://github.com/ggrigo/align/releases/tag/v0.6.0)).

The operating charter — voice, decision authority, failure protocol — is available on request; a public mirror is being prepared. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the agent's operating model on issues and PRs, and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security-disclosure routing.
